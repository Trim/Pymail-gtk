        Pymail
        * The configuration should use forms to edit the configuration file
        * The mail sender should use more than only one smtp server and should propose which the user want to use
        * The http link should be place between the <a> XML balise or something else...
        * Found a resolution of html mail reading (using python-mozembed ?)
